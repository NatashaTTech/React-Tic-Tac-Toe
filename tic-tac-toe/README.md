# Tic Tac Toe

## How to Get Started

1. Open a terminal and navigate into to the Tic-Tac-Toe root directory. (This is the same folder that contains this README file.)

    You will need to install the appropriate node modules to use the app.

2. In the terminal, run:

    `npm install`

    Now that all of your dependencies have been installed, you can now start the server.

4. In the terminal, run:

    `npm start`

If everything is successful, inside your terminal it will output:

    Compiled successfully!

    You can now view tictactoe in the browser.

    Local:            http://localhost:3000/
    On Your Network:  http://(your-network-address):3000/

Tic Tac Toe should automatically open in a new tab or window in your browser, but if it doesn't:

Navigate to <http://localhost:3000> to play Tic Tac Toe!
